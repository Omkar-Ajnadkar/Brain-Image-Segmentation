# Brain Image Segmentation
Smart India Hackathon -2019 Finalist

## Worked on Following Medical Datasets:
- BraTS 2018
- MrBrains18

## Models:
- Modified VGG16
- Modified UNetCNN

## Interface:
- GUI using Python PyQt with the ability to visualize the results along with accuracy in real-time
- The website made using Django that works the same as GUI but with easy and better visualization

## Results:
- Segmented parts of the brain in the 4D dataset with average dice score of 0.84.
- Able to find the tumor in the dataset with average dice score of 0.92

## Examples:
